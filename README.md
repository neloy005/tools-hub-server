## Description
I've built a tools manufacturer website with client side and server side. Where a buyer can use tools in bulk. It's not an e-commerec site. Instead it's B2B website. 

## Features of my website
* User authentication implemented using firebase
* Admin route created and protected from regular user
* Secure payment method implemented
* Mongodb CRUD operation used everywhere.
* Nested route created for dashboard
